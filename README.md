<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>


<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

Step 1: Firstly, create two virtual machines. The first virtual machine will be the domain controller. Its name will be DC-1, and its image type will be Windows Server 2022. The Virtual Network (Vnet) that is now established should be noted since it will be required for our second virtual machine.
</p>

</p>

Furthermore, make sure that DC-1's virtual Network Interface Card (NIC) Private IP address is set to static. To achieve this, navigate to the network settings of the DC-1, select networking, and then click the link next to network interface.
<br />

</p>

Next, choose ipconfig1 from the IP Configurations menu. To ensure that DC-1's IP address won't change, simply select Assignment from Dynamic to Static. 
</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
The 2nd virtual machine will represent the Client, labeled Client-1, and Windows 10 Pro will be the image type. Use the same Vnet and resource group as DC-1.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />

<p>
Step 2: Access Client-1 by logging in with Microsoft Remote Desktop. You then want look for a command line, open it, and ping DC-1's private IP Address (in our instance, 10.0.0.4). Select ping - t 10.0.0.4. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The request is timing out due to the firewall. On DC-1's local Windows firewall, we must activate ICMPv4 to fix issue. Utilizing Microsoft Remote Desktop, log in to DC-1, begin by selecting Start and Windows Administrative Tool, and then select Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security -Inbound rules. Additionally, enable the two inbound rules for Core Networking Diagnostics ICMPv4 by locating it in the list of protocols.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />
<p>
Finally, log back into Client-1, and the command line will begin to successfully ping DC-1.
</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Step 3: Return to DC-1 and select "Add roles and features" in Server Manager after logging back in. Follow the guidelines. Select "Active Directory Domain Services at Server Roles.  Then click on Add Features next. Finish installation by selecting next.

</p>

<p>
Afterwards, click on the flag in the top right corner of the Server Manager Dashboard. Then select, ‚ÄúPromote this server to a domain controller‚Äù. 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Additionally, choose "Add a new forest" - "Root domain name: mydomain.com", then choose "Next" to Create password, and lastly, select "Next" and adhere to the instructions, then click Install to complete the process. Ultimately, DC-1 will restart itself; as a result, log back in as user: mydomain.com\labuser..

</p>
<br />

<p>
Step 4: Open Server Manager on DC-1, choose tools in the upper right corner, and then choose Active Directory Users and Computers. Right-click MyDomain.com, choose "New," and then "Organizational Unit" (We will be creating 2 folders.)

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/p0BZRX8.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New OU"/>
</p>

<p>
Assign one the name _EMPLOYEES and the other _ADMINS. The new organizational units will be sorted to the top if you right-click mydomain.com and choose refresh. Go to the _ADMINS organizational unit and use the right-click menu to pick New, then User. Once that is done, you must enter the following data: First/Last name: jane doe and user login name: jane_ admin. After that, choose next, enter a password, then uncheck every box, click next, and finally select finish.

</p>
  
<p>
Furthermore, go to _ADMINS organizational unit and right click Jane doe then select properties. Click the "member of" tab and select Add then type in domain admins then select Check Names and select OK and then Apply. Log out of DC-1 as "labuser" and log back in as ‚Äúmydomain.com\jane_admin‚Äù

Step 5: Go back to Client-1 Virtual Machine via the Azure interface. Select Networking from the menu on the left, click the link next to the NIC, choose DNS server, then click Custom. Type in the private IP address of DC-1 and click Save. Once the update is complete, choose restart and then click yes.

<p>
Congratulations!üéâ You have set up on-premises Active Directory and generated users inside of Azure Virtual Machines.
